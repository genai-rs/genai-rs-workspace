Renovate therefore falls back to the hosted app defaults and cannot align with the org’s preferred behavior.

Recommended follow-ups for demo:\n- add a repo-level renovate.json5 that mirrors the shared library baseline (schedule window, labels, grouped patch/minor auto-merges, security fast-track)\n- keep `rangeStrategy: update-lockfile` so the application lockfile stays current\n- consider whether any critical deps (e.g., Axum, Langfuse/OpenTelemetry crates) should be marked for manual review similar to the library configs.\nUntil such a config exists, demo will continue relying on Renovate defaults and may miss lockfile bumps or grouped updates.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"chore","assignee":"agent","created_at":"2025-10-21T15:42:52.576292+02:00","updated_at":"2025-11-03T19:47:42.212789+01:00","closed_at":"2025-10-21T17:02:45.72858+02:00","source_repo":"."}
