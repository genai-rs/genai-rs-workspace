# Meta Documentation

This directory contains organization-level documentation and analysis that spans multiple repositories in the genai-rs organization.

## Contents

- **RENOVATE_ANALYSIS.md** - Comparative analysis of Renovate configuration across genai-rs repositories, evaluating dependency management strategies for library crates vs applications.
- **RELEASE_AUTOMATION.md** - Playbook describing how release-plz-driven automation publishes new crate versions and how to adjust release PRs before merging.

## Purpose

Unlike repository-specific documentation, these documents provide cross-repository insights, best practices, and organizational standards. They inform decisions about tooling, automation, and development workflows across the entire genai-rs ecosystem.
